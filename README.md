Writing a GUI application to manage student information system which should allow:

- Collect course information and store it in a separate data file. Each course is identified by an unique ID. The user should be able to view/edit an existing course information. User is not allowed to edit the key field such as Course ID.
- Collect enrollment information. Here you allow the user to enroll students to courses. You make sure that the user types valid student ID and course ID. You display the student and course infoormation in the winddow. You will have to store enrollment information in a separate binary file. This file may contain the course, student ID, year and semester information.
